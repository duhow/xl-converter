Powerful image converter for the latest formats with support for multithreading, drag 'n drop, and downscaling.

Available for Windows and Linux.

## Supported Formats

Encode to **JPEG XL, AVIF, WebP, and JPEG**. Convert from **HEIF** and [more](https://xl-docs.codepoems.eu/supported-formats)

## Features
#### Out of the Box

Just drop your images and convert. XL Converter works out of the box with no setup or steep learning curve. It prioritizes user experience while granting access to cutting-edge technology.

#### Parallel Encoding

Encode images in parallel to speed up the process. Control how much CPU to use during encoding.

#### Lossless JPEG Recompression

Losslessly transcode JPEG to JPEG XL, and reverse the process when needed.

#### Image Proxy

Avoid picky encoders. A proxy is generated when an encoder doesn't support a specific format.

For example, this enables HEIF -> JPEG XL conversion.

#### Downscaling

Scale down images to resolution, percent, shortest (and longest) side, or file size.

#### Smallest Lossless

Utilize multiple formats to achieve the smallest size.

#### Intelligent Effort

Optimize `Effort` for smaller sizes.

#### Metadata

Easily copy and wipe metadata using encoder parameters or ExifTool.

#### JPEGLI

Generate the highest quality (regular old) JPGs with JPEGLI.

## Building from Source

> [!NOTE]
> The recommended way of using XL Converter is through the [official binary releases](https://codepoems.eu/xl-converter). The building process is time-consuming and tedious.

### Windows 10

Install:
- Python `3.11.9` (with `pip`)
- `git`

Clone the repo.

```cmd
git clone -b stable --depth 1 https://github.com/JacobDev1/xl-converter.git
cd xl-converter
```

[Provide tool binaries](#providing-tool-binaries).

Setup `venv`.

```cmd
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install [redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

Run the application

```cmd
python main.py
```

You can also build it.

```cmd
python build.py
```

### Linux (Ubuntu-based)

Install packages.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git make
```

Install [xcb QPA](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux-requirements.html) dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt install '^libxcb.*-dev' libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrender-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev
```

Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) via [Automatic installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#automatic-installer) then [add it to shell](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv)

Install Python build packages.

```bash
sudo apt install wget build-essential libreadline-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
```

Build and setup Python `3.11.9`.

```bash
pyenv install 3.11.9
pyenv local 3.11.9
```

Clone and set up the repo.

```bash
git clone -b stable --depth 1 https://github.com/JacobDev1/xl-converter.git
chmod -R +x xl-converter
cd xl-converter
```

[Provide tool binaries](#providing-tool-binaries).

Create and activate a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you can run it.

```bash
make run
```

...or build it.

```bash
make build
```

Extra building modes:
- `make build-7z` - package to a 7z file (with an installer) (requires `p7zip-full`)
- `make build-appimage` - package as an AppImage (requires `fuse`)

### Providing Tool Binaries

To build XL Converter, you need to provide various binaries. This can be quite challenging.

Binaries needed:
- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl) `0.10.2` ([with this patch on Windows](https://github.com/JacobDev1/libjxl-utf8))
    - cjxl
    - djxl
    - jxlinfo
    - cjpegli
- [libavif](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libavif) `1.0.4` (AOM `3.8.2`)
    - avifenc
    - avifdec
- [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/) `7.1.1-15 Q16-HDRI`
    - magick - AppImage for Linux
    - magick.exe - Windows
- [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) `12.77`
    - exiftool.exe - Windows
    - exiftool - standalone Perl build
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng) `0.9.0`

Place them in the following directories:
- `xl-converter\bin\win` for Windows (x86_64) 
- `xl-converter/bin/linux` for Linux (x86_64) 

Build everything statically.

> [!TIP]
> See the official [XL Converter builds](https://github.com/JacobDev1/xl-converter/releases) for examples.

## Info

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project runs on Python `3.11`. Other versions are not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget `--depth 1` when running `git clone` to avoid large files.

## Unit Testing

### Running

[Setup repo](#building-from-source).

Create a test environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv env_test
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Run tests

```cmd
python test.py
```

### Deprecated

`test_old.py` is a deprecated, but still accessible test suite focusing on the conversion results.

```bash
python test_old.py
```
